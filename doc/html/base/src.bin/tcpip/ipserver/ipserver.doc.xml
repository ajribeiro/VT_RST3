<synopsis><p>Simple TCP/IP server program.</p></synopsis>

<description><p>The task is a demonstration of a TCP/IP server. It waits for clients to connect and then sends a string containing the date and time to them every few seconds.</p></description>
<example>  
<command>ipserver -L log  -pf port.id  -if pid.id</command>
<description>Listen for clients on a port allocated by the operating system. The port number is recorded in the file "<code>port.id</code>", the process identifier is recorded in the file "<code>pid.id</code>", and logs of all transactions are recorded in the file "<code>log.<ar>xxx</ar></code>" where <ar>xxx</ar> is the day of the year.</description>
</example>
<example>
<command>ipserver -L log  -pf port.id  -if pid.id -lp 5000</command>
<description>Listen for clients on a port 5000. The port number is recorded in the file "<code>port.id</code>", the process identifier is recorded in the file "<code>pid.id</code>", and logs of all transactions are recorded in the file "<code>log.<ar>xxx</ar></code>" where <ar>xxx</ar> is the day of the year.</description>
