<description><p>The <fn href="OldGridFread.html">OldGridFread</fn> function reads old formatted gridded data from an open stream.</p>
<p>The gridded data is read from the open stream pointed to by the argument <ar>fp</ar>. The gridded data is stored in the structure pointed to by the argument <ar>grd</ar>.</p>
</description>
<returns>Returns the number of bytes used to store the convection map on success. On error, (-1) is returned.</returns>

<description><p>The <fn href="OldGridFseek.html">OldGridFseek</fn> function searches for old formatted gridded data for a specific time.</p>
<p>The search is performed on the open stream pointed to by the argument <ar>fp</ar>. The time to search for is specified by the arguments <ar>yr</ar>, <ar>mo</ar>,<ar>dy</ar>,<ar>hr</ar>,<ar>mt</ar>,<ar>sc</ar> giving the year, month, day, hour, minute and second.</p>
<p>The argument <ar>atme</ar> is a pointer to a double precision floating point number that is used to store the time of the closest record to the time requested expressed in seconds from 0:00UT January 1, 1970. If this argument is set to a <code>NULL</code> pointer then the time is not returned.</p>  
<p>If the file containing the gridded data has an associated index that has been loaded, then it can be used to speed up the search by setting the argument <ar>inx</ar> to point to it.</p>
</description>
<returns>Returns zero on success. On error, (-1) is returned.</returns>
<errors>On error, (-1) is returned.</errors>
