<description><p>The <fn href="GridTableFwrite.html">GridTableFwrite</fn> function writes gridded data to an open stream.</p>
<p>The data is written to the stream pointed to by the argument <ar>fp</ar>.If <ar>fid</ar> is set to (-1) then the function will just calculate the number of bytes required to store the data.</p>
<p>The gridded data is taken from the structure pointed to by the argument <ar>ptr</ar>.</p>
<p>If the argument <ar>logbuf</ar> is not a <code>NULL</code> pointer, the a log of the number grid points written is stored as a zero terminated string at this address.</p>
<p>If the argument <ar>xtd</ar> is set to a non-zero value, then extended information including the power and spectral width is recorded in addition to the velocity data.</p>
</description>
<returns>Returns the number of bytes written on success. On error, (-1) is returned.</returns>
<errors>On error, (-1) is returned.</errors>
